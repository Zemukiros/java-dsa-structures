# java-dsa-structures

A collection of Java projects demonstrating advanced concepts in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Data Structures**, and **Algorithms**.  
Developed as part of my Computer Science coursework, these projects highlight real-world applications of **linked lists**, **hashing**, **trees**, and **graph-based systems**, all implemented with modular, test-driven, and enterprise-ready architecture.

**Key Features:**  
- Implemented hashing with chaining via linked lists to resolve collisions.  
- Designed `CourseDBElement`, `CourseDBStructure`, and `CourseDBManager` classes for modular design.  
- Integrated file I/O for reading and saving course data, and exception handling for invalid operations.  
- Ensured full compliance with provided interfaces and automated JUnit testing.  
**Key Concepts:** Hash Tables, Interfaces, File I/O, Exception Handling, Test-Driven Development.  
**Technologies:** Java, Data Structures, OOP.

### 4. Project 5 — Morse Code Converter (Binary Tree Implementation)  
Developed a **Morse Code Converter** using a binary tree to translate Morse sequences into English text.  
**Key Features:**  
- Built a `MorseCodeTree` using recursive insertion of dots (left) and dashes (right).  
- Implemented `fetch()` and `insert()` for traversal and decoding of Morse patterns.  
- Created `MorseCodeConverter` utility for converting both text and file input.  
- Performed in-order traversal to validate tree structure and ensure accurate translation.  
**Key Concepts:** Binary Trees, Recursion, File Handling, Traversal Algorithms, JUnit Testing.  
**Technologies:** Java, OOP, Tree Structures.


### 5 Project  — Dictionary Builder (Hash Table Implementation)

Developed a Dictionary Builder using a custom hash table with separate chaining to store, search, and manage words efficiently.
Key Features:

**Key Features:**  
Built a HashTable class from scratch using linked-list chaining to handle collisions.

Implemented insert(), delete(), and search() with average O(1) performance.

Designed a DictionaryBuilder utility to load words from files and dynamically update the dictionary.

Added deep copy and equality logic to ensure data integrity across nodes and chains.
**Key Concepts:** Hash Tables, Separate Chaining, Generics, File I/O, OOP Design, and Recursion.
**Technologies:** Java, Data Structures, Custom Collections.
